Name of the project: TODO

## Background ##
Streaming services are now on the wave of popularity, not only due to the pandemic, but also due to the fact that entertainment is an integral part of human leisure. People of all ages and views watch movies and series for different purposes, some just to relax, some want to immerse themselves in a fantasy world, and some pursue the goal of getting to know our world better. Also people like to talk about movies and share their opinion on the series they enjoy. This creates word-of-mouth buzz that gets others watching so they can be part of the conversation too.
Previously, people went for DVDs to spend the evening, later broadcasting channels connected. However, what makes a streaming service different from the above is that it offers freedom of choice along with convenience and affordability.

## Objective ##
Consumers want access to a broad content mix, including original series, and a substantial library of movies and popular TV series.

As for the goals, the streaming service has one main goal - to give a person content here and right now, be it a movie, a show, a series, etc. Moreover, this goal is achieved by a search query of the consumer himself. That is, if a person wants to relax and watch something, but does not know what he wants, there should be a mechanism for offering content and / or searching with filters, by which one could find something according to his mood.

Therefore, the main goals are:
Displaying content to the consumer (film, series, etc.)
Suggestion based on browsing history
Ability to search and discover new films and genres
Pleasant user interface that is not loaded with unnecessary information
Be affordable or have a reasonable price

## Target audience ##
These are millennials, those people who know how to use technology for their convenience and who want to watch movies, series, etc. We mainly focus on the age of up to 40. 
As studies show, these people mainly use similar services. (https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/research/audience-and-brand-building/streaming-audience-analysis/)

## Business model ##
Since all people are annoyed by ads, especially those that interfere with the achievement of goals, we will use a Subscription-based Business Model. That means that its main revenue stream is the monthly fees. In this case, we don't need to show ads to keep our platform working and improve the user experience.
